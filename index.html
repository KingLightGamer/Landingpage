              <p>Cats are known for their incredible flexibility. They can almost completely roll onto their side and squeeze through tight openings. This is thanks to their unique spine, which allows them to move so freely.</p></div>

          <p>Cats have very fine hearing and can detect sounds in the ultrasonic range. This helps them locate prey like mice, which are inaudible to humans. Their ears are also highly mobile, allowing them to pick up sounds from different directions.</p></div>

          <p>Most cats are naturally very clean animals. They spend up to 50% of their waking hours grooming themselves to keep their fur clean and free of parasites. Grooming also helps them regulate their body temperature and reduce stress.</p></div>

          <p>Cats have a special way of communicating: they purr not only when they are happy but also when they are in pain or stressed. Purring can have a calming effect on both themselves and people around them. It's a fascinating behavior with many different meanings!</p></div>
